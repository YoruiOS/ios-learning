# Case Study: <App Name>

## Problem
What problem were you solving? Who is the user? What constraints existed?

## Approach
Key decisions, trade-offs, and architecture diagrams (MVVM boundaries, data flow).

## Technical Highlights
- Swift 6 concurrency (async/await, actors)
- Persistence (SwiftData) or networking (caching, retries, cancellation)
- App Intents / Widgets / BackgroundTasks / StoreKit
- Accessibility (VoiceOver, Dynamic Type), localization
- On-device AI (if applicable)

## Results
- Metrics (launch time, memory, crash-free %, TestFlight feedback summary)
- What you’d change next and why

## Links
- App Store / TestFlight
- GitHub repo folders or code anchors for key parts
- 2-min demo video
